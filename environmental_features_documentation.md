## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

The application uses a structured data model for environmental information:

```python
environmental_data = {
    "current_temperature": 42,
    "heat_warning_level": "Warning",
    "water_status": "Shortage",
    "water_schedule": {
        "Al-Kut": "6:00-9:00 AM, 6:00-8:00 PM",
        # Other districts...
    },
    "cooling_centers": [
        {"name": "Al-Kut Community Center", "address": "Main Street, Al-Kut", "hours": "10:00 AM - 8:00 PM"},
        # Other centers...
    ],
    "emergency_contacts": {
        "Water Emergency": "+964 7XX XXX XXX",
        # Other contacts...
    }
}
```

### Knowledge Base Integration

Environmental knowledge is organized in the following categories:

1. **Water Conservation**: Practical water-saving techniques with quantified benefits
2. **Heat Safety**: Comprehensive guidance for dealing with extreme temperatures
3. **Agricultural Adaptation**: Specialized advice for farmers facing environmental challenges
4. **Emergency Resources**: Information about available emergency services
5. **Climate Information**: Data about weather patterns and climate trends

### UI Enhancements
