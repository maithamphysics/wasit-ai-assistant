# Environmental Challenges in Wasit, Iraq

## Water Scarcity

### Current Situation
- Wasit is experiencing decreasing water allocation due to national water scarcity
- Iraq's water supply from the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (98% of total supply) has decreased by 30%
- By 2025, water supply is projected to decrease by up to 60% compared to 2015 levels
- The agriculture sector in Wasit has suffered significantly due to water shortages
- Water scarcity is creating conflicts among local communities within Iraqi provinces

### Contributing Factors
- Declining water flows from upstream countries
- Intensive water usage by oil and agricultural industries
- Rising demand due to population growth
- Insufficient rainfall and increasingly dry climate
- Poor water management and infrastructure
- Climate change impacts on precipitation patterns

### Impacts on Wasit
- Reduced agricultural productivity
- Threats to food security
- Economic losses for farmers
- Potential population displacement
- Increased competition for limited resources
- Deteriorating water quality
- Conflicts between different water users (agriculture, domestic, industrial)

## High Temperatures

### Current Situation
- Wasit experiences extremely hot summers with temperatures reaching up to 48.1째C
- The annual average temperature in Wasit is 29.2째C, which is 2.43% higher than Iraq's average
- Monthly temperature ranges:
  - June: 34.2째C to 42.8째C
  - July-August: Even higher temperatures
  - Winter months (December-February): Mild with occasional cold spells

### Contributing Factors
- Geographic location in a hot, arid region
- Global climate change leading to rising temperatures
- Urban heat island effect in populated areas
- Reduced vegetation cover
- Limited cooling infrastructure
- Drought conditions exacerbating heat

### Impacts on Wasit
- Heat-related health issues (heat stroke, dehydration)
- Increased energy demand for cooling
- Reduced outdoor working hours during summer
- Stress on infrastructure (roads, buildings, power grid)
- Higher evaporation rates exacerbating water scarcity
- Negative effects on agricultural productivity
- Decreased livestock health and productivity

## Interconnected Challenges

The water scarcity and high temperature issues in Wasit are deeply interconnected:

- High temperatures increase evaporation rates, worsening water scarcity
- Water scarcity reduces vegetation, which would otherwise provide cooling effects
- Both issues negatively impact agriculture, the primary economic activity in Wasit
- Energy demands for cooling and water pumping strain limited resources
- Combined effects create health risks, especially for vulnerable populations
- Both challenges are expected to worsen with climate change

## Current Mitigation Efforts

- Limited water conservation programs
- Some agricultural adaptation techniques
- Basic heat advisory systems
- Infrastructure development projects (with varying effectiveness)
- International aid programs addressing water management

## Opportunities for AI-Assisted Solutions

- Real-time monitoring and prediction of water availability
- Optimized water distribution systems
- Smart irrigation technologies for agriculture
- Heat warning systems and health advisories
- Energy efficiency recommendations for cooling
- Data-driven policy recommendations
- Community education and engagement tools
