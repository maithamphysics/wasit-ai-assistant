## Water Conservation Guidance

### Household Conservation
- **Indoor Water Saving Tips**:
  - Fixing leaky faucets (saves up to 20 liters per day)
  - Installing water-efficient fixtures (reduces usage by 30-50%)
  - Shorter showers (reducing by 2 minutes saves 15-20 liters)
  - Reusing washing machine water for cleaning or irrigation
  - Collecting and using gray water for appropriate purposes
  
- **Outdoor Water Conservation**:
  - Watering gardens during early morning or evening to reduce evaporation
