We identified key challenges, mapped potential AI applications, assessed implementation feasibility, and developed a structured roadmap for adoption.

### 1.3 Strategic Context
As Iraq continues its decentralization process, local governments like Wasit have increasing responsibility for development and service delivery. AI technologies offer powerful tools to enhance governance capacity, optimize resource allocation, and improve citizen services in this context.

## 2. Background and Current Situation

### 2.1 Wasit Governorate Profile
Wasit Governorate, located in eastern Iraq bordering Iran, has a population of approximately 1.45 million, predominantly Shia Arabs. The governorate's economy is based on farming, oil, and natural gas, with historical unemployment and poverty rates of 10% and 35% respectively (as of 2007).

### 2.2 Governance Structure
Wasit is governed by an elected provincial council that appoints the governor, currently Mohammed Jameel al-Miyahi. The governorate is divided into six districts: Al-Aziziyah, Badra, Al-Hai, Kut, Numaniyah, and Suwaira. Under Iraq's 2008 Decentralization Law, Wasit receives shared oil and customs revenue from the federal government.

### 2.3 Economic Development
Wasit has experienced significant budget growth, increasing from $173 million in 2017 to $792 million in 2022. This growth has enabled substantial investment in infrastructure, basic services, and industrial and educational sectors, with a reported 97% project completion rate as of 2022.

### 2.4 Infrastructure Development
Current infrastructure projects include "New Wasit City" (a residential development approved in 2024), road development (79% complete as of November 2024), the Wasit Oil Authority Buildings Project, and a planned waste treatment and power generation plant. Wasit has also received presidential endorsement to become an agricultural center.

### 2.5 Digital Infrastructure
While specific data on Wasit's digital infrastructure is limited, Iraq overall is transitioning from a cash-dependent economy to digital payments, with the Central Bank of Iraq leading digital finance initiatives supported by UNDP and USAID. However, outdated internet and telecommunications infrastructure remain barriers to digital transformation.

### 2.6 Governance Improvements
Wasit has gained a reputation for effective governance, with successful public-private dialogue and a reformist coalition winning a majority in recent provincial council elections. The focus is shifting to longer-term strategic priorities like tourism, industry, and sustainable development.
